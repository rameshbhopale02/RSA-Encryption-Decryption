A random data generator can be useful
 if you're doing cross-browser testing. 
 For example, if you need to write tests
  that fill forms with random data (such
   as random strings or random zip codes),
    then you can use this program to generate 
    as many random data elements as you need 
    and put them in your test cases. You can
     independently generate random strings 
     of any length made out of lowercase or
      uppercase characters, including single-character
       strings. You can also generate random numbers
        and random text snippets from a custom 
        alphabet. The generated data can also be used for random 
        file names or random IDs in tests.
